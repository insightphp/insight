# Elements

Elements is an essential standalone package which provides set of basic Vue UI components.
The UI components are already styled using Tailwind CSS and this gives you great 
starting point for building application UI  without having to worry about basic UI component styling.

This UI kit is a foundation for all Insight features, such as Forms, Tables, Panels or Insight itself. 
You can use this package to build your custom Insight plugin which will perfectly match the look and feel 
of the Insight application when your plugin is installed.

Elements can be also installed as a standalone Vue library, so you can use all UI components directly just by
importing them.

All components are written in typescript so types for all components are provided.

The style of the components is opinionated and mostly tries to match Tailwind-kind of styling, like Tailwind UI.
However, you can still adjust a lot of styling using Tailwind config, so final look may be adjusted according to your needs.
